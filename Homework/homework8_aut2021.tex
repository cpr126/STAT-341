\maketitle

This take home assignment is due on Mon Jan 17 by \textbf{midnight} PST.

\textbf{Instructions}: Follow each one diligently.
\textbf{No exceptions.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Please type your answers and upload as a PDF. If you prefer to write your answers, we will accept handwritten work provided it is legible. If you decide to go this route, be sure to [scan](https://www.camscanner.com) and upload a single file.  
    \item Write your full name (as it appears in the grade book) on the first page, preferably as a running header on each page.
    \item Answer the questions in order and number them as I have here. Write complete answers which includes justifications for steps and/or references to results you use. This is really important.
    \item Clearly indicate your final answer. Put a frame around it where appropriate.
\end{enumerate}

  Pruim problem 3.17 on page 216. The time \(X\) (in seconds) between
  two randomly selected consecutive cars in a traffic flow model is
  modeled with PDF \[f(x) = \frac{k}{x^4}, \ \  \ \ a \leq x < \infty\]

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Determine the value of \(k\) in terms of \(a\).
  \item
    Obtain the CDF of \(X\).
  \item
    If \(a=1\) what is \(P(2 \leq X \leq 3)\).
  \item
    What is \(E\left[X\right]\) and what does it tell you about traffic
    in this model?
  \item
    What is the standard deviation of \(X\)?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Suppose \(X \sim Unif(0,1)\). Find \(E\left[ -\ln(X) \right]\) using
  the law of the unconscious probabilist.
\item
  The diameters of ball bearings from a particular company are normally
  distributed. In order to quickly determine the parameters of the
  normal distribution, one determines the proportion of bearings going
  through sieves with circular holes of different sizes. If 23\% of the
  bearings go through a hole of diameter 4.9 mm and 59\% go through a
  hole of diameter 5.0 mm, what are the mean and standard deviation of
  the diameters of the entire population? Assume the ball bearings are
  spherical.

  Be sure to practice writing clearly. This means define the random
  variable and clearly state what you are calculating before you launch
  into it.
\item
  The time between repairs of a device can be reasonably modeled with an
  exponential distribution if we believe that the events that cause the
  device to fail occur according to the Poisson model. The following are
  the repair intervals (measured in hours of service time between
  repairs).
\end{enumerate}

49.0, 60.4, 8.9, 43.4, 34.8, 8.2, 3.6, 11.5, 99.4, 31.9

\textbf{Fit} an exponential distribution and a gamma distribution on the
same graph and compare the results just visually. (You will need to find
the parameter values of the distributions by matching the theoretical
mean and/or variance with their sample counterparts.)
