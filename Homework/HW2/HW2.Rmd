\textbf{Instructions}: Follow each one diligently. \textbf{No exceptions.}

```{=tex}
\hrule
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Please type your answers and upload as a PDF. If you prefer to write your answers, we will accept handwritten work provided it is legible. If you decide to go this route, be sure to [scan](https://www.camscanner.com) and upload a single file.  
    \item Write your full name (as it appears in the grade book) on the first page, preferably as a running header on each page.
    \item Answer the questions in order and number them as I have here. Write complete answers which includes justifications for steps and/or references to results you use. This is really important.
    \item Clearly indicate your final answer. Put a frame around it where appropriate.
\end{enumerate}
